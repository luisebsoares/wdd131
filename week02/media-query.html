            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>27. And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may
                be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble
                themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Alma 18:34-35</h2>
            <p>34. Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and I
                am
                called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought to a
                knowledge of that which is just and true;</p>

            <p>35. And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to
                my faith and desires which are in God.</p>
